Description: Provides functions for simulating and estimating parameters of various growth models, including Logistic, Exponential, Theta-logistic, Von-Bertalanffy, and Gompertz models. The package supports both simulated and real data analysis, including parameter estimation, visualization, and calculation of global and local estimates. The methods are based on research described by Md Aktar Ul Karim and Amiya Ranjan Bhowmick (2022) in (<https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2363586/v1>). An interactive web application is also available at [GPEMR Web App](<https://gpem-r.shinyapps.io/GPEM-R/>).
